## 💡 What It Is

`repository-harness` is a **repository-level operating harness** for Claude Code,
Codex, Cursor, and other coding agents. It gives agents the missing project
context they need *before* they change code: where to start, what the product
contract says, how risky the work is, what proof is required, and which decisions
future agents should inherit.

> **In short:** a drop-in set of Markdown docs plus a small Rust CLI that you
> install into any repository so coding agents have a consistent place to learn
> project intent, classify risk, record stories and decisions, and prove their
> work — before they edit code.

It ships **no application of its own**. It is the operating layer you add around
whatever you are building.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository (`thanh-dong/harness-repository-cc`) is a **customized fork**,
> tuned for my own Claude Code projects. The original work is by
> [Hoang Nguyen (@hoangnb24)](https://github.com/hoangnb24/repository-harness) —
> see [Acknowledgements](#-acknowledgements).

This project is exploring a simple idea:

> Coding agents do not only need better prompts. **They need better repositories.**

## 🎯 The Problem

Most repos are built for humans reading code in a familiar codebase. Coding
agents usually enter with only a chat prompt and a shallow snapshot of files.
That leads to common failure modes:

- 🔧 The agent edits code before understanding product intent.
- 🗣️ Important constraints live only in chat history or in someone's head.
- ❓ Validation expectations are vague or discovered too late.
- 🔁 Architecture tradeoffs are repeated instead of inherited.
- 📦 Large requests do not get broken into reviewable story-sized work.

---

## 🧭 The Harness Approach

A repository starts to have a harness when it helps an agent answer practical
engineering questions without relying only on chat history:

> *What should I read first? · What type of work is this? · Which product
> contract does it affect? · How risky is the change? · What proof shows the work
> is done? · What decision should future agents inherit?*

In this repo, those answers live in:

| Path | What it provides |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | The stable agent shim with local project notes and Harness doc links. |
| `docs/HARNESS.md` | The human–agent collaboration model. |
| `docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md` | Tiny, normal, and high-risk work classification. |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Architecture discovery and boundary rules. |
| `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md` | Behavior-to-proof validation expectations. |
| `docs/stories/` | Story packets and backlog items. |
| `docs/decisions/` | Durable decisions and tradeoffs. |
| `docs/templates/` | Reusable spec, story, decision, and validation templates. |

OpenAI describes this shift as an agent-first world where humans steer and agents
execute → <https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/>

## 🚀 Installation

Install the harness into a target project. From that project's directory, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thanh-dong/harness-repository-cc/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --yes
```

This applies the Harness operating files (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, story and
decision templates) and downloads the prebuilt Harness CLI into
`scripts/bin/harness-cli`. Add `--claude` if the project is driven with Claude
Code so the harness context is auto-loaded into every session.

On **Windows PowerShell**, run:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thanh-dong/harness-repository-cc/main/scripts/install-harness.ps1"))) -Yes
```

### Agent Self-Setup

Hand this block to a coding agent to install and verify the harness on its own,
from inside the target project directory:

```bash
# 1. Install the harness files and the prebuilt CLI (use --claude for Claude Code)
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thanh-dong/harness-repository-cc/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --claude --yes

# 2. Create the durable database
scripts/bin/harness-cli init

# 3. Verify the install: CLI runs and the test matrix is queryable
scripts/bin/harness-cli --version
scripts/bin/harness-cli query matrix

# 4. Read the entry points before changing code
#    AGENTS.md, docs/HARNESS.md, docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
```

On Windows the CLI is called as `.\scripts\bin\harness-cli.exe`.

### Install Options

| Goal | Flag | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Update an existing Harness repo (keep existing files) | `--merge` | `… install-harness.sh … \| bash -s -- --merge --yes` |
| Back up and replace `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, `scripts/` | `--override` | `… install-harness.sh … \| bash -s -- --override --yes` |
| Refresh an old full `AGENTS.md` into the small shim | `--refresh-agent-shim` | `… \| bash -s -- --merge --refresh-agent-shim --yes` |
| Auto-load harness context in Claude Code | `--claude` | `… \| bash -s -- --claude --yes` |
| Install into a specific path | `--directory <path>` | `… \| bash -s -- --directory /path/to/project --yes` |
| Preview without writing | `--dry-run` / `-DryRun` | `… \| bash -s -- --dry-run` |

PowerShell uses the equivalent switches: `-Merge`, `-Override`,
`-RefreshAgentShim`, `-Yes`, `-Directory`, `-DryRun`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Flag details</strong></summary>

- **`--merge`** — append newly added Harness files without moving the existing
  `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, or `scripts/` paths into backup. Existing files stay
  untouched; only missing Harness files are created.
- **`--refresh-agent-shim`** — for older installs whose `AGENTS.md` still
  contains the full generated operating guide. The refresh backs up the existing
  file. If it detects the old Harness-generated guide it replaces it with the
  shim; if the file appears custom it appends or updates a marked Harness block
  instead of overwriting the project's local instructions.
- **`--claude`** — Claude Code never auto-loads `AGENTS.md`, so without this the
  installed harness is invisible to fresh sessions. The flag installs (or
  refreshes) a `CLAUDE.md` whose marked Harness block `@`-imports `AGENTS.md` and
  `docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md` into every session's context. An existing `CLAUDE.md`
  gets the block appended after a backup; plain installs without the flag never
  touch `CLAUDE.md`.

### About The Prebuilt CLI

The installer downloads the prebuilt Harness CLI for the current platform,
verifies its `.sha256` checksum, and installs it at `scripts/bin/harness-cli`
(macOS/Linux) or `scripts/bin/harness-cli.exe` (Windows). The Rust CLI is the
main Harness tool and stable command path.

Release assets are published from tags by the `Harness CLI Release` GitHub
Actions workflow, with `harness-cli-<platform>` and `harness-cli-<platform>.sha256`
assets for macOS arm64, macOS x64, Linux x64, Linux arm64, and Windows x64 (the
Windows asset is `harness-cli-windows-x64.exe` plus its `.sha256`).

Merged PRs are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md` by the `Post-Merge Maintenance`
workflow; when a merged PR changes the Rust CLI source, schema, Cargo metadata,
or CLI release packaging, that workflow bumps the CLI patch version, updates
`scripts/harness-cli-release-tag`, creates a `harness-cli-v*` tag, and runs the
release build for that tag.

## 🛠️ Run From A Clone

To work on the harness itself, or to use the CLI and installer directly from a
checkout instead of the remote one-liner:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thanh-dong/harness-repository-cc.git
cd harness-repository-cc
```

**Use the prebuilt CLI** that ships in the repo:

```bash
scripts/bin/harness-cli --version      # macOS/Linux
scripts/bin/harness-cli init
scripts/bin/harness-cli query matrix
```

**Or build the CLI from source** (requires the Rust toolchain):

```bash
cargo build --release -p harness-cli
./target/release/harness-cli --version
```

**Run the installer from the local checkout** against a target project, sourcing
the harness files from this clone rather than GitHub:

```bash
HARNESS_SOURCE_BASE_URL="file://$(pwd)" \
  scripts/install-harness.sh --directory /path/to/project --merge --yes
```

Pass `--dry-run` to preview the file changes first. `HARNESS_SOURCE_BASE_URL`
overrides where harness files are fetched from; `HARNESS_CLI_BASE_URL` overrides
where the prebuilt CLI is downloaded from (for example a local `dist/` directory
produced by `scripts/build-harness-cli-release.sh`).

> See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for the full CLI command reference
> and release packaging.

## 🔄 Try The Flow

The fastest way to understand the harness is to inspect the tiny demo at
[`docs/demo/README.md`](docs/demo/README.md): it shows how a simple product idea
becomes product docs, stories, validation expectations, and decisions before
implementation starts.

A typical flow looks like this:

```text
human intent or product spec
  ➜ product contract
  ➜ feature intake
  ➜ story packet
  ➜ validation expectations
  ➜ implementation work
  ➜ decision or lesson captured for future agents
```

Implementation prompts do not go straight to code. They first pass through
feature intake, become story-sized work when needed, and then carry both product
validation and harness maintenance expectations.

---

## 🔌 Tool Registry

The harness can use optional external tools (linters, code-graph servers, deploy
checks) **without depending on any of them**. You register a tool as a provider
of a *capability*, the harness scans whether it is actually present, and a
workflow step uses whatever is equipped — an absent tool is a clean skip, never a
failure.

```bash
# register a tool as a provider of a capability
scripts/bin/harness-cli tool register --name deploy-check --kind cli \
  --capability deploy-verification --command ./scripts/deploy-check.sh \
  --responsibility Verification --description "Verify deploy health before release"

# scan presence (writes present/missing/unknown)
scripts/bin/harness-cli tool check

# a step looks up what is equipped for a purpose
scripts/bin/harness-cli query tools --capability deploy-verification --status present
```

Kinds (`cli`, `binary`, `mcp`, `skill`, `http`) make it agent-generic: each agent
runtime uses what it can orchestrate. See
[`docs/TOOL_REGISTRY.md`](docs/TOOL_REGISTRY.md) for the full model, the degrade
ladder, and how to wire a tool into a flow step.

## 📍 Current State

This repository is in **Harness v0**.

There is no application implementation and no baked-in product specification yet.
The current work is the reusable project harness: the file structure, agent
operating model, feature intake process, story templates, and validation
expectations that help humans and agents turn a future user-provided spec into
implementation work.

### Product Sources

No product contract is currently defined. When a project specification is
provided, add or reference it as the input spec for the first buildout, then
derive smaller living artifacts from it:

- `docs/product/` — current product contract files, created from the spec.
- `docs/stories/` — story packets and backlog created from selected work.
- `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md` — behavior-to-proof control panel.
- `docs/decisions/` — durable decisions and tradeoffs.

Do not keep a project-specific spec or product breakdown in this harness until a
real project supplies one.
